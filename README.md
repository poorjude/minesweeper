## Minesweeper game in console
To run: download `minesweeper.exe` and open it.

Features:
1. Completely functional Minesweeper game with standard rules.
2. Possibility to choose any field size and any amount of mines.
3. Possibility to save game records and view them later.

`minesweeper.cpp` contains all the code. It is written mostly in C style but has some C++ syntax features, so it can be compiled in a C++ compiler only.

The program will work correctly only in the Windows OS - this is due to the usage of console commands.
